During my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in data modeling, statistical analysis, and algorithm design. My final year project, where I developed a robust text summarization application using Django, PyPDF2, and Hugging Face Transformers, is a testament to my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also honed my ability to manage projects and deliver solutions that meet user requirements.
Dashboards:
To provide users with a comprehensive and intuitive overview of the summarized content, the experimental phase included the development of interactive dashboards. 
These dashboards offer a centralized platform for users to access and explore the generated summaries, customized according to their preferences.
